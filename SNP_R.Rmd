##Fit regression models in R to model disease using the predictor variables. Your models should include main effects only, interactions only and a full model with both main effects and interactions. The step function may assist you. Produce a final model containing all the predictors you find that are significant.

```{r}

#Interpretation
According to the results from Model 1, logistic regression was calculated to predict disease based on 10 locations of mutation. A significant regression equation was found : class = -0.25Location11 + 0.48Location51 + 0.58Location52 + 0.62Location101 + 0.34Location102 - 0.69

1. Participant's location 1 with 1 mutation decreased risk 0.78 times for the odds of having the disease when comparing with no mutation.
2. Participant's location 5 with 1 mutation increased risk 1.63 times for the odds of having the disease when comparing with no mutation.
3. Participant's location 5 with 2 mutation increased risk 1.80 times for the odds of having the disease when comparing with no mutation.
4. Participant's location 10 with 1 mutation increased risk 1.87 times for the odds of having the disease when comparing with no mutation.
5. Participant's location 10 with 2 mutation increased risk 1.40 times for the odds of having the disease when comparing with no mutation.
(When all other variables in the model are held constant.)
